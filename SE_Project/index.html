  <!--About Course-->
  <div>
    <h1>What is Software Engineering?</h1>
    Software engineering is the branch that focusing on programming, developing software systems in the service of mankind.
    This course covers the fundamentals of software engineering, including understanding system
    requirements, effective methods of design, coding, and testing.

  <!--How is Software Engineering differ from Multimedia and Network branch?-->
  <div>
    <h1>How Software Engineering differ from Multimedia and Game Development and Network and System Technology branch?</h1>
    For Multimedia and Game Development, students in this branch will learn about front-end development and the use of creativity.
    But for Software Engineering, we are focusing on back-end developing and deep programming.
    Network and System Technology will focus on network.

  <!--What you need to do/to have if you are interested in this branch-->
  <div>
    <h1>What I need to do/to have if I am interested in this branch and do not have strong experience?</h1>

    It would be easier to enter this branch if you have some experience in programming.

    We also have pre-programming course for PSIT subject which you will learn about Python language.
    This would help you make decision and be more confident in yourselves.

    Here at IT faculty, we have 3 programming subjects which are Problem Solving in Information Technology,
    Computer Programming, and Object Oriented Programming. The computer language that students will learn in these subjects
    are Python, C, Java.
