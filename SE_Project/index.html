    <div>
        What I need to do/to have if I am interested in this branch and do not have strong experience?

            It would be easier to enter this branch if you have some experience in programming.

            We also have pre-programming course for PSIT subject which you will learn about Python language.
            This would help you make decision and be more confident in yourselves.

            Here at IT faculty, we have 3 programming subjects which are Problem Solving in Information Technology,
            Computer Programming, and Object Oriented Programming. The computer language that students will learn in these subjects
            are Python, C, Java.

    <div>
        How Software Engineering differ from Multimedia and Game Development and Network and System Technology branch?
            For Multimedia and Game Development, students in this branch will learn about front-end development and the use of creativity.
            But for Software Engineering, we are focusing on back-end developing and deep programming.
            Network and System Technology will focus on network.
